  abstract = {The exponential expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in transformative potential across science, industry, and society. However, it simultaneously incurs significant environmental, social, and economic externalities that necessitate immediate and thorough examination. This chapter meticulously examines AI’s sustainability challenges and potential solutions by synthesizing inter-disciplinary research. Through a comprehensive lifecycle analysis, the study evaluates AI’s global footprint, scrutinizing AI’s extensive resource demands—ranging from computational overhead and climatological implications of deploying large-scale neural networks with escalating parameter counts to the mass energy consumption, material extraction costs, and ecological degradation associated with model training and inference phases. In particular, the analysis delves into the carbon footprint of hyperscale data center operations, the environmental toll of cooling mechanisms, and the social ramifications of algorithmic biases that perpetuate social inequalities and resource inequity. The study highlights the immense carbon emissions generated during the training of advanced models, such as GPT-3, which emitted approximately 1.2 million pounds of CO2, equivalent to the lifetime emissions of 10 average cars [56]. The massive computational resources required for the training and inference of AI models contrast starkly with the urgent need to minimize environmental impacts, highlighting the growing energy demands that significantly outpace Moore’s law [72].<br /><br />Furthermore, this chapter bridges the research gap in sustainable AI development and its current challenges by proposing actionable pathways for achieving sustain- ability. By incorporating peer-reviewed studies, industry benchmarks, and policy frameworks, it identifies emergent mitigation strategies for sustainable AI. These include the development of energy-efficient GPU architectures, Green AI frameworks prioritizing low-carbon operations, algorithmic optimizations through model pruning and quantization, hardware-software co-design, and the integration of renewable energy into computational infrastructure [60], [72]. Additionally, the chapter addresses social and economic issues, advocating for algorithmic fairness techniques, privacy-preserving machine learning, and initiatives to democratize AI resources, particularly in regions lacking technological infrastructure [86]. Aligning innovation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability principles and the triple bottom line framework requires interdisciplinary collaboration, policy innovation, and a paradigm shift in AI development to balance technological progress with societal well-being and planetary health. This research composition ultimately advocates for a holistic and balanced approach to AI development that harmonizes technological progress with environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic viability imperatives. It contributes a roadmap for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to advance equitable, resource-conscious AI systems through cross-disciplinary collaboration, policy reform, and ethically grounded innovation.},
