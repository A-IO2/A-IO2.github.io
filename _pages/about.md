Hi, I’m Ola. I’m passionate about event organizing and software project management from concept to completion. I’ve successfully led 20+ events, engaging over 50 satisfied attendees. At Brock University, I contributed to and oversaw several initiatives, including courseMix.ca. I’ve leveraged tools like Jira, GitHub Projects, Microsoft Excel, and ClickUp to manage sprints, streamline workflows, foster cross-functional collaboration, and deliver intuitive solutions to intricate challenges.
