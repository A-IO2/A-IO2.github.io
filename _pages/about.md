Hi, Iâ€™m Ola. I enjoy organizing events, planning and managing software projects. I've done 20+ events, encompassing 50+ satisfied attendees. At Brock uni, I was involved in numerous projects such as courseMix.ca. I utilized Jira, Github projects, Microsoft excel and even clickup to manage sprints, manage workflows, foster interunit communication, and engineer intuitive solutions to collaboratively intricate challenges.
