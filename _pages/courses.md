Introduction to Cybersecurity (COSC 4P50):
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I found it both engaging and rewarding, completing it with a final grade of 100% (a little flex). Leveraging the SEED Lab 2.0 framework in a secure Linux environment, I conducted hands-on exercises in privilege escalation, shell and environment variable manipulation, system exploitation techniques, and much more. I acquired practical experience in identifying and securing vulnerable systems, substantially strengthening my understanding of system-level security and attack mitigation strategies.
